Let us first define some terms. As discussed before, pre-humanism describes the groups of philosophies that base their morality on something ‘pre-human’. This, I would argue, encapsulates most forms of religion (god / gods as a moral basis) and extreme forms of veganism / anarcho-primitivism that see the circle of life as a moral basis. Humanism see’s morality as something humans should decide, and could be expressed in an almost infinite amount of ways in practice (marxism, democracy, neoliberalism if you really want to). Post-Humanism should encompass what comes after humanism; basing our morality on something destinctly posthuman. This could mean aliens, robots, cyborgs, etc.\nAs of late, I have started finding myself drift further from post-humanism, and back towards boring old humanism. This is not because I feel that humans are inately rational creatures, or that I (personally) believe that humans have a great grasp on morality as a whole. Actually, I think humans have a very poor sense of morality, and it’s because we made it up. It doesn’t exist.\nIf we are to take a secular look at the universe, there should be no fundamental difference between a human and a rock. Both are made of matter, both store and expell energy. From our understanding of the universe, it holds the rock in no lower or higher regard than the human. And if the rock fell on the human, would that be morally wrong? Has the rock committed a crime? Of course not, but what if we took the rock, refined it, and made a self aware supercomputer, and then the supercomputer chose to fall on the human. Has the rock committed a crime now?\nWhat has changed with the rock is we have given it the power of choice. We have brought it into the realm of morality. I think most would say that the rock has very much committed a crime, and that by chosing to hurt the human, the rock can be considered guilty.\nAnd I would agree, but this is because I am morally inconsistant. We all are. Morals do not exist, and how we chose to apply them is completely subjective. There is no morality test, to way to measure morality, so we do our best to approximate with philosophy and ideology. But at what point did the rock become guilty? At what point in its transistion did it graduate from an inanimate object to a moral being? We see the robot chose to hurt the human, and we definitively say that the robot is guilty, without having to first define what guilt even is.\nSo, if morals are completely subjective, how can we give a truly post-human being morals? If this being had human morals, would it even be able to be considered post-human? Furthermore, how can we insure that a superintelligent being would even want to learn more about the universe? How could we be sure it would want to do anything?\nWe are only driven to live, to learn, or anything else because of our inate instinctual need to do so. Natural selection has chosen these traits to be more likely to make us produce and care for our offspring. Our morality too, our drive to care for those that care for us, is completely instinctual. If we make an artificial intelligence that we tell to have these wants as well,we are imposing our instinctual needs on a being that has no need for them. In doing so, we should accept that this being would be, in essence, human. No matter the physical form it should take.\nA truely post-human being would not have these needs, and because of this would likely do nothing at all. Much like how a desktop computer does nothing unless it is told to do so.\nA secular humanist or post-humanist should accept that conciousness is a lie that our brains tell itself because it was found to be evolutionarily beneficial. In reality there is no difference between us and the rock. We are not concious. Nothing is. We are just as inanimate and dead as the next clump of stardust. Each of us, a small part of the universe trying to make sense of itself. The meaning we gain in this life will mean no more than the meaning that the rock gains before it is swollowed by the sun. Meaning itself being something we invented.\nIf someone is willing to accept this, and make an artificial being that can go beyond typical human reasoning, but still exhibits a will to live and to learn, I would probably call that being transhuman. It is heavily augmented, but still bound by human wants and desires.\nA truly post-human world, unbound by human morality, already exists. In fact it is all around us. It was always there, and always will be.\n","wordCount":"856","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://posting-humanism.github.io/posts/morality/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://posting-humanism.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:#1d1e20;--entry:#2e2e33;--primary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.84);--secondary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.56);--tertiary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);--content:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);--hljs-bg:#2e2e33;--code-bg:#37383e;--border:#333}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><span class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></span></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://posting-humanism.github.io/ title=home><span>home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://posting-humanism.github.io/archives/ title=archives><span>archives</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Post-Human Morality</h1><div class=post-meta></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Lets revisit posthumanism, and the kinds of posthumanism that could exist.</p><p>In a world where we are looking beyond humanism, and exploring where we could base our morality on something other than human conciousness, we really do need to explore the idea that thought itself is not all that important.
