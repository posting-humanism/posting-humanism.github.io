Well, ok, usually it means that. But hear me out.\nI’ve heard this argument coming up a lot in leftist circles, and thought it should be addressed. As I have mentioned before, I think there are a lot of benefits to becoming an interplanetary species (or even interstellar, if possible). To summarize: it vastly reduces the chances of us, and potentially all of life, being destroyed. When we all rely on one biosphere, we put quite a bit of faith in it’s not so guaranteed stability. When we spread out, we could have a whole network of habitable worlds that would have to be rendered uninhabitable to put an end to life. That seems preferable to me.\nBut that’s not really the lines along which this argument usually takes place. Most of the time, I’ve heard it spelled out something like this: “Elon (and a lot of other misguided sci-fi readers) claim to want to spread out into the stars to bring humanity to its next natural evolution, but the only reason they assume that it is the next evolution of our society is because they have been conditioned, after hundreds of years of colonization, to see such things as noble and righteous. In reality, space colonization is a capitalist’s wet dream, and would only serve to benefit the ruling class just as colonization always has.”\nI think the problem with this subject really comes down to the language we use around it, rather than the actual consequences of putting humans on Mars. That’s not to say there aren’t problems. There are plenty of technically issues we have barely begun to start working on. And, of course, under our current system the main goal of putting humans on another planet wouldn’t be the preservation of our species, but rather, a new source of profit. It might end up doing both, but there is a very real chance we end up with some sort of Blade Runner-esque future where the wealth gap just continues to grow ever larger due to a now cosmically sized market.\nHopefully we get Star Trek instead. But what’s concerning to me currently is how we describe these actions. Words like “colonization”, “settlement”, “pioneer”, and “frontier” get thrown around a lot when talking about our future in space. This isn’t bad in a vacuum (haha), but especially in today’s post-colonial world, these words don’t really have the same meaning as they used to. Colonialism, for many people, conjures up images of genocide, war, slavery, and mass rape. Rather than being a picture of courage and exploration, in a lot of people’s minds, colonialism conjures images of the most horrific things humanity is capable of.\nAs I said before though, there is growing discourse around whether or not space colonization IS colonization. Or rather, if it is simply an extension of it, and the natural continuation of a global colonial project. The suggestion being that if we were able to break our colonialist mindset, we would not be trying to go to space. Frankly, this is absurd. And honestly pretty insulting to colonized peoples as well. Putting humans on Mars lacks one key feature that putting European colonies on America did: native people. There is no life on Mars (as far as we can tell). There is no way to commit genocide, or destroy culture, or displace people from their lands on Mars. NASA would have to try pretty hard to recreate the war crimes that Columbus commited out there.\nColonialism is bad. It has left a horrible mark on our society, and the effects of it will probably continue to harm people for generations to come. But it should not affect our goal of becoming a space faring species. I suggest we think of new terms to describe such efforts, so they do not bring up images of earth based colonialism, and I suggest we recognize that if we are going to compare the two, it should be about how to make sure we don’t get some sort of “space wild west” situation. I love space western sci-fi as much as anyone else, but Firefly was about a dystopia, not a model society. Elon Musk’s lithium child mining operations do not suddenly get better if they are in space with epic 420 gamer lights everywhere.\nOf course, if we do find aliens then this will evolve into an entirely different conversation. As I have mentioned before, I find it highly unlikely that if we do find life out there that it will be even remotely “conquerable”, but still. For now, space really is just a bunch of, well, land. Useful land, full of possibilities and discoveries to be made. This shouldn’t be concerning, and if we can make sure people like Elon Musk aren’t in charge, spreading out in the solar system could benefit all of us.\n","wordCount":"842","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-12-09T09:22:48-07:00","dateModified":"2021-12-09T09:22:48-07:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://posting-humanism.github.io/posts/space-colonialism/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://posting-humanism.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
