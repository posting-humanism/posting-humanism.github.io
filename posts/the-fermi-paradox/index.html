It is not a very soft pebble, and the hill it is sitting on is fairly small compared to the others around it. The pebble might even be described as coarse. Some parts, perhaps even sharp. This pebble has had no chance to soften over the years due to the planet it resides on having no atmosphere to speak of, and therefore has nothing to erode away at its unpleasant surface. How long has the pebble been here? It is not sure. In fact, it isn’t quite sure of anything at all. It has a hard time with memory. Such is the state of a pebble, I suppose.\nUnbeknownst to the pebble, an entire year (which, on this planet, is roughly 892 Earth years) passes. The pebble has not moved off the hill, but has sunk a few grains of dirt further down as the dirt settled slightly below it. 30 more of this planet’s years pass. The pebble is just sitting there, minding its own business when suddenly, out of nowhere, a meteor strikes the planet. Horrible cracks in the crust rupture the upper layers of this planet’s surface. The planet has no tectonic movement, as it has no molten core, but the effects of the meteor simulate the effects of an earthquake for miles around. The pebble is quite more than a few miles from the impact, but is jostled slightly anyway and slides halfway down the hill it was on. “This is some bullshit”, the pebble might have thought, but doesn’t, and then continues to not think at all.\nAlmost 10,000 more years have passed on this planet. Due to the further settling of the soil from the impact, the pebble has slowly slid to the bottom of its small hill. A few more smaller impacts have occurred nearby, but nothing exciting enough to give this pebble its damn view back. “Sigh…” the pebble doesn’t say. A beautiful comet, completely obscured due to the lack of an atmosphere, is illuminated overhead. The pebble doesn’t see it.\nAfter almost 1,000,000 of this planet’s years later (close to a billion earth years), the pubble has decayed somewhat from the faint solar radiation of the far away star it is orbiting, but the differences are minor. The solar system is going under a planetary switch due to an unlikely alignment of planets closer in messing with the stability of the outer orbits. How rude. Due to this, the planet is pulled inward, and suddenly (over the course of 1000 Earth years), is flung around the star and slingshotted out into space. The heat and the tidal forces of being so near to the sun shift the soil around the pebble significantly. It is now very warm, and completely buried.\nOut in the cold dark of space, the pebble sits there, stationary as ever, and now robbed of any remains of the view it once had. The planet it resides on is doomed to a life without a star. A rogue planet. A lonely planet. Eventually, it finds itself in the void, drifting on the subtle gravity of stars light years away over the course of untold years. Eventually, the stars begin to die out, and the planet notices nothing. Slowly, the darkness it had grown accustomed to becomes ever darker. What happens next is hard to say. But, the pebble remains. The pebble endures.\n This story is playing out across countless worlds in countless galaxies. The universe is mind bogglingly massive, operates on timescales inconceivable to the human mind, and, as far as we know, very nearly empty. Unless you are some sort of “anti-life-ist”, this should concern you. The universe is full of pebbles, and stars for them to orbit, going about their dance for billions of years. No one is there to appreciate them. No one there to even observe them in the first place. So much space, serving no apparent purpose. Everything, just going about its business in some giant, random, pointless dance.\nIt concerns me, at least. Barring some sort or religious meaning, it is hard for me to imagine a reason for all this. The thought of a truly empty universe fills me with a terrifying existential dread. A dread I need only to look up to be reminded of.\nI would like to think that we are not alone. That this planet is not the only place worth living in all the universe.\nIf we really are the only life out there, that would mean that life itself is so exceedingly rare that it would be safe to assume if our planet dies, life would never grace this universe again. The universe would just continue its cosmic dance, with no one to see it, until the heat death eventually consumes it.\nIf that is really what anti-life-ist’s want I think they should be jailed.\nSo why am I telling you this? Just to bring the mood down? No, I want to make a potentially controversial point about the importance of humans. If we are alone in the universe, then the fate of all life, period, is in the palm of our hands. If we mess up, if we go into nuclear war, or climate change gets too bad, or hell, even if we aren’t able to stop a devastating comet from hitting Earth, it’s not just us who are fucked, but all life in the universe could be snuffed out. Forever.\nNow, many of you are probably thinking to yourself “But what if we aren’t alone in the universe. It’s incredibly unlikely that humans are the only life out there.” Other’s of you are probably also thinking things like “Why is this post called the fermi paradox?” and “Why don’t you just take anxiety medication?”\nLet’s start with the Fermi Paradox. As much as it begrudges me to go back there, the wikipedia has a good summary:\n The Fermi paradox, named after Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi, is the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial life and various high estimates for their probability (such as some optimistic estimates for the Drake equation).\n This is the heart of the issue. When people claim that we probably aren’t alone, they are probably right. It would be extremely surprising to me if we were alone in the universe. The math simply doesn’t add up. As the wikipedia elaborates in it’s summary:\n The following are some of the facts that together serve to highlight the apparent contradiction:\n There are billions of stars in the Milky Way similar to the Sun. With high probability, some of these stars have Earth-like planets in a circumstellar habitable zone. Many of these stars, and hence their planets, are much older than the Sun. If the Earth is typical, some may have developed intelligent life long ago. Some of these civilizations may have developed interstellar travel, a step humans are investigating now. Even at the slow pace of currently envisioned interstellar travel, the Milky Way galaxy could be completely traversed in a few million years. And since many of the stars similar to the Sun are billions of years older, Earth should have already been visited by extraterrestrial civilizations, or at least their probes. However, there is no convincing evidence that this has happened.   This is fairly convincing. This universe is too vast and complicated for anything in it to be truly unique. For all we know, there are thousands, if not millions of Earth like planets in every galaxy. And that is not to mention the fact that Earth might not even be the ideal case. There could be planets out there that are even better suited for life, that make the Earth look like some kind of barren wasteland in comparison.\nBut, as is pointed out in the summary above, we have no proof. We don’t believe we are alone, because statistically that would be almost impossible, but we have never observed other life.\nMy argument is this: Until we know we are not alone, it is dangerous to assume we are.\nSure, it would be nice to not feel responsible for all life in the universe, but we can’t just assume it’s safe to do whatever we want with the life on our planet until we know just how rare it is. The stakes are just too high, and I don’t think enough people are thinking about this from this framework. Many people just assume that there is probably already some higher intelligence out there. Maybe god really is out there, or some highly evolved race, or maybe the universe itself is part of some master plan we could never even comprehend and the thing we call “life” is just some insignificant by-product of the larger goal.\nBut what if none of that is true? We have never observed anything to say that any of it is. The safe thing to do in this scenario would be to cherish life on Earth for what it is. Nurture life and safeguard it from outside, and internal, harm.\nI will get into how I think this should happen in my next post, but before I go I would like the address the argument some people might be rearing to make here which is that the framework I am proposing is very similar to Pascal’s wager. If you don’t know Pascal’s wager by name, you have probably heard it before:\n A rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.), whereas if God does exist, he stands to receive infinite gains (as represented by eternity in Heaven) and avoid infinite losses (eternity in Hell).\n Pascal, an old philosopher from the 1600s, was not trying to convert people to his faith. He was merely trying to show how hard it is to make logical arguments against a theory based on faith. Of course, his very eurocentric wager falls apart when other, mutually exclusive religions are considered, but I think he still got his point across. Am I making a similar argument? In a sense, yes. But this is not about faith, or belief. I am not asking anyone to become some sort of nihilistic space cultist. I am simply trying to point out how the precarious, volatile world we live in might be more important that we give it credit for. And, as I’m sure I don’t really need to point out, the situation in this world doesn’t seem to be trending in any sort of “positive” direction.\nAs far as we know, we humans are the only beings in the whole universe of saving this planet. And if we don’t, we could be dooming the universe to an existence of uncaring, unmoving, coarse pebbles, drifting in the darkness for all eternity.\n","wordCount":"1820","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-07-13T23:48:58-07:00","dateModified":"2021-07-13T23:48:58-07:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://posting-humanism.github.io/posts/the-fermi-paradox/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://posting-humanism.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add('dark'):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove('dark'):window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:#1d1e20;--entry:#2e2e33;--primary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.84);--secondary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.56);--tertiary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);--content:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);--hljs-bg:#2e2e33;--code-bg:#37383e;--border:#333}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><span class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></span></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://posting-humanism.github.io/ title=home><span>home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://posting-humanism.github.io/archives/ title=archives><span>archives</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>The Fermi Paradox</h1><div class=post-meta>July 13, 2021</div></header><div class=post-content><p>A pebble sits on a hill.
