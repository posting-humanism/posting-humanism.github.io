You've read the title, and you see my blog. You keep reading this sentence and you see the following words: "Let's, together, go into this ideology with a completely blank slate." You think to yourself "you know, I've been needing a new ideology for a bit now" and you agree.
Together, we both clear our minds. We close our eyes, and we see nothing. We feel nothing. We let the void envelope our senses. Without reading this sentence, we keep moving our eyes while keeping them closed and open them right at the perfect time to see the word again: "Post-humanism".
When we see "post-humanism", the first images that come to our mind are, predicatably, robots and AI. We think of Terminator or The Matrix. Maybe even iRobot. In our minds we see wars between the righteous, freedom loving humans and the evil robots that will stop at nothing to grab power by *AHEM* fighting to no longer be slaves.
Quickly, we shift our focus. We dont follow the clear lines that can be drawn from post-colonial fears of treating the other as an equal and the plots of these stories. We try to clear our minds again. We are both clever people, and we know that these images are simply our own internal biases rearing its ugly head. 
Now, we let our own bias flow away, and choose to search for the term on wikipedia, allowing our bias to be crowdsourced instead.
