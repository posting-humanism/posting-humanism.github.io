Now that we know what post-humanism is, we can finally figure out what some post-human ideologies might look like under our definition. Remember, the goal of any post-humanist ideology should be to at least shift the "starting point for serious moral and philosophical inquiry" away from to human, and to something else.

I am going to porpose a few real subsects I've observe within this fake ideology I made up:

 - Vegan post-humanism (please trust me)
 - Anti-life-ism
 - Religious post-humanism
 - Constructed Intelligence Post-humanism

Let's start with the vegans. I would not classify regular vegan idealogy as necessarily post-human. Vegans, even while being the subject of ridicule for most of the 2010s, actually have a pretty clean and sound ideology. They believe that if humans should be given rights, then animals should deserve rights as well. Simple. But not post-human. This does not shift any emphasis away from the human. At best, a minimal shift. The rights being described are destinctly human defined rights. Did the vegans ask the animals what rights they should persue? No. They made that choice for them. Do the animals they save like not being eaten? Probably. It's actually extremely likely. But that is still a humanist framework. Vegans also, suspiciously, only give rights to animals. Not to plants, fungus, bacteria, etc. This is because vegans still need to eat something to survive, and so limit the extent of their ideological demands to those which it will be easiest to convince other humans are worth of protection; those which we can relate to the most: Animals. Sure, they can argue that animals are concious and plants are not, but, just like other humans, vegans never seem to be able to define what "conciousness" even means. At the end of the day, vegans are just as bad as the trans-humanists. They expand upon the principles layed out by humanism, sure, but are ultimately just human-adjacent. Not post-human.

So, what would post-human veganism look like? Well, it has to "shift the starting point for serious moral and philosophical inquiry". Last time we discussed this as a rule, but we haven't actually tried to find an example that follows the rule. Vegan Post-Humanism should go beyond just giving animals rights, but actually find that the animals, or even plants, know better than we do.

full circle arguement goes here

anti-life-ism 

google hindism and discuss how norse and greek mythologies are solid attempts to be post-human, but they still feel pretty human
