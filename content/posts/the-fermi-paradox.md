A pebble sits on a hill. It is not a very soft pebble, and the hill it is sitting on is fairly small compared to the others around it. The pebble might even be descibed as coarse. Some parts, perhaps even sharp. This pebble has had no chance to soften over the years due to the planet it resides on having no atmosphere to speak of, and therefore has nothing to erode away at its unpleasent surface. How long has the pebble been here? It is not sure. In fact, it isn't quite sure of anything at all. It has a hard time with memory. Such is the state of a pebble, I suppose.

Unbeknownst to the pebble, an entire year (which, on this planet, is roughly 892 Earth years) passes. The pebble has not moved off the hill, but has sunk a few grains of dirt further down as the dirt settled slightly. 30 more of this planet's years pass. The pebble is just sitting there, minding it's own business when suddenly, out of nowhere, a meteor strikes the planet. Horrible cracks in the crust rupture the upper layers of this planets surface. The planet has no techtonic movement, as it has no molten core, but the effects of the meteor simulate the effects of an earthquake for miles around. The pebble is quite more than a few miles from the impact, but is jostled slightly anyway and slides halfway down the hill it was on. "This is some bullshit", the pebble might have thought, but doesn't, and then continues to not think anything.

Almost 100,000 more years on this planet pass. Due to the further settling of the soil fromt he impact, the pebble has slowly slid to the bottom of its small hill. A few more smaller impacts have occured nearby, but nothing exciting enough to give this pebble its damn view back. "Sigh..." the pebble doesn't say.
