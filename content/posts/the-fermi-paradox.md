A pebble sits on a hill.
It is not a very soft pebble, and the hill it is sitting on is fairly small compared to the others around it.
The pebble might even be descibed as coarse.
Some parts, perhaps even sharp.
This pebble has had no chance to soften over the years due to the planet it resides on having no atmosphere to speak of, and therefore has nothing to erode away at its unpleasent surface.
How long has the pebble been here? It is not sure.
In fact, it isn't quite sure of anything at all.
It has a hard time with memory.
Such is the state of a pebble, I suppose.

Unbeknownst to the pebble, an entire year (which, on this planet, is roughly 892 Earth years) passes.
The pebble has not moved off the hill, but has sunk a few grains of dirt further down as the dirt settled slightly.
30 more of this planet's years pass.
The pebble is just sitting there, minding it's own business when suddenly, out of nowhere, a meteor strikes the planet.
Horrible cracks in the crust rupture the upper layers of this planets surface.
The planet has no techtonic movement, as it has no molten core, but the effects of the meteor simulate the effects of an earthquake for miles around.
The pebble is quite more than a few miles from the impact, but is jostled slightly anyway and slides halfway down the hill it was on.
"This is some bullshit", the pebble might have thought, but doesn't, and then continues to not think at all.

Almost 10,000 more years on this planet pass.
Due to the further settling of the soil from the impact, the pebble has slowly slid to the bottom of its small hill.
A few more smaller impacts have occured nearby, but nothing exciting enough to give this pebble its damn view back.
"Sigh..." the pebble doesn't say.
A beautiful comet, completely unobscurred due to the lack of an atmosphere is illuminated overhead.
The pebble doesn't see it.

After almost 1,000,000 of this planets years later (close to a billion earth years), the pubble has decayed somewhat from the faint solar radiation of the far away star it is orbiting, but the differences are minor.
The solar system is going under a planetary switch due to an unlikely alignment of planets closer in messing with the stability of the outer orbits.
How rude.
Due to this, the planet is pulled inward, and suddenly (over the course of 1000 Earth years), is flung around the star and slingshotted out into space.
The heat and the tidal forces of being so near to the sun shift the soil around the pebble signiciantly.
It is now very warm, and completely buried.

Out in the cold dark of space, the pebble sits there, stationary as ever, and now robbed of any remains of the view it once had.
The planet it resides on is doomed to a life without a star.
A rouge planet.
A lonely planet.
Eventually, it finds itself in the void, drifitng on the subtle gravity of stars light years away over the course of untold years.
Eventually, the stars begin to die out, and the planet notices nothing.
Slowly, the darkness it had grown accustomed to becomes ever darker.
What happens next is hard to say.
But, the pebble remains.
The pebble endures.

This story is playing out across countless worlds in countless galaxies.
The universe is mindbogglingly massive, operates on timescales inconcievable to the human mind, and, as far as we know, very nearly empty.
Unless you are some sort of "anti-life-ist", this should concern you.
The universe is full of pebbles, and stars for them to orbit, going about their dance for billions of years.
No one there to appreciate them.
No one there to even observe them in the first place.
So much space, serving no apperent purpose.
Everything just going about its business in some giant, random, pointless dance.

It concerns me, at least.
Barring some sort or religious meaning, I would like to think that we are not alone.
That this planet is not the only place worth live all in all the universe.
