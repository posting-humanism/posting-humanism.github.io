The most prolific method for stupidity measurement is the intelligence quotient (or IQ). The lower you score on an IQ test, the stupider you are, right? Well hold on, we've skipped a pretty important step here: what is intelligence? If your intelligence was simply defined by your IQ score, and had no real world effect, finding out how intelligent you are would be the same as finding out your zodiac sign.
