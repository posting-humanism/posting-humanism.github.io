Do you consider yourself smart? Do you know your IQ score? Do you get really weird about IQ statistics? Do you sometimes start bringing up IQ statistics to people who dont want to hear it to try to prove points about "certain groups" in ways that have been scientifically debunked countless times? Do you then try to argue with your friends, who clearly just want to pretend to enjoy more league of legends, that these same "certain groups" are in fact the *same ones* who are conducting the studies and this is all part of their marxist-laser conspiracy to start wildfires in California from space? Have you ever, even a single time in your life, touched grass?

No? Good, I consider myself stupid too. But lets talk about why I'm stupid and, specifically, how I would even measure how stupid I am. The most prolific method for stupidity measurement is the intelligence quotient (or IQ). The lower you score on an IQ test, the stupider you are, right? Well hold on, we've skipped a pretty important step here: what is intelligence? If your intelligence was simply defined by your IQ score, and had no real world effect, finding out how intelligent you are would be the same as finding out your zodiac sign. Except worse because instead of getting a cool symbol and getting to chill with the hot-alt-crystal gang, you get a boring number and now a bunch of racists want to talk to you about why having a body pillow of an anime girl doesn't make you a race traitor.

When we imagine someone intelligent (clearly not ourselves, but bear with me), some traits start coming to mind. This person knows a lot of things. This person can solve problems fast. This person has supports public infrastructure spending. But if we were to think of intelligent traits as something that an AI can have, suddenly we have to grapple with the fact that our idea of "intelligence" is not so simple. If someone was intelligent just because they knew a lot of things, or could solve problems really fast, then we could make a super intelligent AI simply by giving a computer more processing speed and a larger memory bank than a human brain. But, of course, we have already done that. Several times over, in fact. And yet, simply letting a machine of that speed run has yielded no super intelligence. What gives?

Personally, I think the problem is two fold:
1. Computers are not amazing at taking information from one problem and applying it to another. At least, not as good as a human is. Yet.
2. Computers have not been given an instinctual drive.
