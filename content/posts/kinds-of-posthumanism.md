Now that we know what post-humanism is, we can finally figure out what some post-human ideologies might look like under our definition. Remember, the goal of any post-humanist ideology should be to at least shift the "starting point for serious moral and philosophical inquiry" away from to human, and to something else.

I am going to porpose a few real subsects I've observe within this fake version of a real ideology that I made up:

 - Vegan post-humanism (please trust me)
 - Anti-life-ism
 - Religious post-humanism
 - Constructed Intelligence Post-humanism

Let's start with the vegans. I would not classify regular vegan idealogy as necessarily post-human. Vegans, even while being the subject of ridicule for most of the 2010s, actually have a pretty clean and sound ideology. They believe that if humans should be given rights, then animals should deserve rights as well. Simple. But not post-human. This does not shift any emphasis away from the human. At best, a minimal shift. The rights being described are destinctly human defined rights. Did the vegans ask the animals what rights they should persue? No. They made that choice for them. Do the animals they save like not being eaten? Probably. It's actually extremely likely. But that is still a humanist framework. Vegans also, suspiciously, only give rights to animals. Not to plants, fungus, bacteria, etc. This is because vegans still need to eat something to survive, and so limit the extent of their ideological demands to those which it will be easiest to convince other humans are worth of protection; those which we can relate to the most: Animals. Sure, they can argue that animals are concious and plants are not, but, just like other humans, vegans never seem to be able to define what "conciousness" even means. At the end of the day, vegans are just as bad as the trans-humanists. They expand upon the principles layed out by humanism, sure, but are ultimately just human-adjacent. Not post-human.

So, what would post-human veganism look like? Well, it has to "shift the starting point for serious moral and philosophical inquiry". Last time we discussed this as a rule, but we haven't actually tried to find an example that follows the rule. Vegan Post-Humanism should go beyond just giving animals rights, but actually find that the animals, or even plants, know better than we do. You might be tempted to argue "but arent humans also animals and therefore deserving of the same rights?" and you would be asking a stupid question. We arent concerned with whether or not the ideology is well thought out, but only whether it fits in our definition. So lets try to figure out how this ideology could be lived out. Vegan post-humanism could be expressed maybe by worshipping animals, or something more reasonable like building a society dedicated to fulfilling the needs of the local eco-system. Either way, this ideology is definitely a cult. Ok yeah, you were right, this first framework is a miss. I'm sorry.

But it gets worse. We could take this a step further and say that humans cant make moral judgements because nothing alive could possibly have an unbiased, approaching correct framework. An anti-life post-humanist, or simply an anti-life-ist, would simply believe that the universe was better off without life to begin with, and that life is somehow antithetical to the purpose of the universe at large. I mean this is simply just a villian take, right? I'm not sure who out here is really more concerned about the safety of rocks over humans, but it does fit our framework. In a way. I guess.

Religious post-humanism is actually fairly straight forward and reasonable and definitely practiced by actual people and not just weird cultists or edgy nerds. But maybe those too. Religious post-humanism could take the form of any religion that de-emphasizes the human, and puts a religious entity as the new starting point for all morals and philosophical inquiry. So, you now, it basically just says god is better than us, and is always right. However, I feel like it's important to point out here that while that makes it sound like basically all religions fall under our definition of post-human, it largely depends on the interperatation of the religion that an individual or sect subscribes to. Classic example: christianity. This is not true of all christian beliefs, but I would say the vast majority of christians take a very human centered take on god. The very idea that an all knowing being would send a human down to Earth specifically to save us is a straight up admission that christians believe that humans are more important than other forms of intelligence. Where was dog-jesus? Who came down to save the souls of the poison dart frogs from sin? Furthermore, all abrahamic religions believe that god created humans in It's image. Morality may have been ordained by god, but if humans are basically just little 3D printed knock offs of god's enternal, all embracing, supple dad bod, they get quite a bit more "emphasis" than anyone else. Just saying.


google hindism and discuss how norse and greek mythologies are solid attempts to be post-human, but they still feel pretty human

sike, that was all pre-humanism. you think im going to let people who worship rocks into my sick new robo-ideology? gtfo nerds.
