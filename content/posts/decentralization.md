Have you ever thought about ants?
Just like...really thought about ants?
They are pretty weird right?
They can lift things way bigger than them. 
They are born into different roles like some sort of biological caste system.
They can organize and act as one or spread out and accomplish many goals at once.
It can be very hard for a predator, or even rival ant hill, to take down a nest.
It is easy to take out an ant, or even dozens of them, but since they are so unified and driven in their pursuit of their goals, you have to essentially take out the whole colony.

Or, simply take out the queen.

The ant's netorious weakness (aside from ant-eaters, I suppose).
They can't reproduce without the queen, and therefore they cant survive for long once she is dead. 
If any female ant could assume the role of queen, ants would be quite a bit more formidable, but they can't.
Instead, an anthill's only chance in the long run is to seed new colonies with new queens.
These new anthills may pose a threat in the future, but without them the ant species as a whole would never survive.
Ants are prolific, and somewhere deep down in their genetic makeup they know that the survival of their species does not depend on one queen, but many.

As you have probably deduced with your impressive cunning and aptitude for perception, the point of this article is to stress the importance of decentralization.
And no, I'm not about to come at you with some sort of Anarcho-post-humanism take about how we should make a bunch of different AI via open source at the same time so they are harder to take out (although that would make a cool premise for a sci-fi book one day).
Rather, I want to stress the importance of decentralization, and how it makes things much harder to kill.
Because, like the ants, we too have a "queen" so to speak, which we cannot live without: Earth.

As I discussed in an earlier post, human's, for all we know, carry the burden of the fate of life in the universe.
There might be other intelligent life out there, but like I explained, it could be potentially catastrophic if we were to break the biosphere on this planet if it truely was the only life supporting planet in the universe.
A very small chance, but one we shouldn't be willing to take.
